# chippyash/Slim-Dic

## Quality Assurance

Coming soon!

## What?

Provides [Symfony Dependency Injection](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/introduction.html) 
for a [Slim Application](http://www.slimframework.com/)

Also provides a minimalist Controller pattern class for use in your applications.

For an example application that uses this library, please see [Slim-DIC Example](https://github.com/the-matrix/Slim-Dic-Example)

## Why?

The Slim framework is great for lightweight sites but lacks the ease of creating
testable, adaptable code that can be found when adopting a strict DI approach to development.

This small library supports the integration of the easy to use, yet powerful
Symfony version of a DI container with the lightweight Slim Framework, giving 
you the ability to create great, maintainable and configurable web sites quickly.

## How?
